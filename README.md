# Startup-Categorization-to-Predict-Likelihood-of-Acquisition
Acquisition prediction deals with choosing correct target companies for the bidder company, and is a challenging task. We will be using the dataset from Crunchbase to predict whether a company   will   be   acquired   and   the   probability   of   company   acquisition.


1. The initial step would be to parse the input data which is in JSON format and then use
pandas   dataFrame   to   form   the   relationships   among   the   dataset.
2. The next step will be to build two models. The first model will predict whether a
company   will   be   acquired   or   not    using   a   Support   Vector   Machine   Classifier.
3. The second model will predict the probability of company acquisition.We  will be predicting “whether a given company will be
most likely to be acquired” on the basis on some attributes like company age,company category,company products etc.  
For this we will be using the naive bayes as our learning algorithm
